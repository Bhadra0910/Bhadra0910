🤖 Building AI chatbots and learning NLP (still figuring out a lot of it!)
💡 Experimenting with GenAI tools - some projects succeed, some teach me what NOT to do
📊 Playing around with data visualization and trying to make sense of numbers
🎯 Leading small teams and discovering that getting people aligned is harder than coding
🌱 Teaching myself Figma through YouTube tutorials and trial-and-error

## 🎭 Beyond the Code

When I'm not building AI solutions, you'll find me:
- 💃 Dancing my heart out
- 🎤 Singing (probably off-key, but passionately!)
- 📚 Lost in a good book or binge-watching the latest series
- 🥋 Teaching karate and mentoring students

I believe the best developers are well-rounded humans. My diverse interests fuel my creativity and help me approach problems from unique angles.

## 🌟 What Makes Me Different

I don't just code - I lead, create, and deliver. Whether it's building an AI chatbot in a 4-day sprint or organizing a biomedical technology event, I bring the same energy: **passion, precision, and a drive to make things happen.**

I'm seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute to cutting-edge AI/ML projects while learning from the best in the industry. Let's build something amazing together!
